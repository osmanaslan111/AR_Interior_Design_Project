AR Interior Design & E-Commerce Simulator
This project is an Augmented Reality (AR) application developed with Unity 6, designed to simulate an interior design and e-commerce experience. It allows users to visualize furniture in their real-world environment using advanced plane detection and surface anchoring.

🚀 Key Features
Real-time Plane Detection: Automatically identifies horizontal surfaces (floors, tables) for object placement.
Dynamic Furniture Catalog: Users can select and switch between different 3D models (Desks, Lamps, etc.).
Object Manipulation: Place, rotate, and interact with assets in a 1:1 scale AR environment.
E-Commerce Workflow: Includes a simulated shopping cart, material customization, and a secure checkout interface.
Cross-Platform AR: Built using AR Foundation for stable performance across mobile devices.

🛠 Technical Stack
Engine: Unity 6 (6000.0.x)
AR Framework: AR Foundation / OpenXR
Input System: New Unity Input System
UI System: TextMesh Pro & Unity UI

📖 How to Use
Launch the application on an AR-supported device or via the Unity Editor Simulator.
Scan the environment to detect horizontal planes.
Select an item from the bottom catalog.
Tap on a detected plane to place the furniture.
Use the UI buttons to customize materials or proceed to the simulated checkout.
